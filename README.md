 A simple application with a GUI using Open Graphics Library(OpenGL) to play game of X's and 0's.
 
 OpenGL (Open Graphics Library)is a cross-language, multi-platform application programming interface(API) for rendering 2D and 3D vector graphics.The API is typically used to interact with a graphics processing unit (GPU),to achieve
 hardware-accelerated rendering.
 
 The API is defined as a number of functions which may be called by the client program, alongside a number of named integer constants (for example, the constant GL_TEXTURE_2D, which corresponds to the decimal number 3553). Although the function definitions are superficially similar to those of the C programming language, they are language-independent.
 
 In addition to being language-independent, OpenGL is also platform-independent. The specification says nothing on the subject of obtaining, and managing, an OpenGL context, leaving this as a detail of the underlying windowing system.
